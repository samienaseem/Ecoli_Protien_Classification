Ecoli Protein Localisation Sites

The protein localisation data set contains a set of 5 features describing the
properties of proteins found in the bacteria Escherichia coli. The location of the
proteins within the cell is also known. The task is to develop a model that can predict
the location of a protein based on the features. The data are sourced from the UC
Irvine Machine Learning Repository, Nakai,Kenta. (1996). Ecoli. UCI Machine
Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C5388M.
The data are available as a CSV file called ecoli.csv on SurreyLearn. You must use
the data set provided on SurreyLearn. Each row in the file corresponds to a single
protein. The columns in the file are:
• X1 to X5 - Features of the proteins
• C – Class. This is the location of the protein. A value of 0 refers to proteins
located in the inner membrane, whereas proteins in the perisplasm are
labelled as 1.
